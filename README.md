# 0x00. AirBnB clone - The console

This is the first step in building a clone of the AirBnB website, which will cover fundamental concepts of higher level programming. The goal is to create a simple command interpreter to manage objects for the website.

The command interpreter will allow users to create, read, update, and delete Airbnb objects, such as users, states, cities, and places. It will also provide a way to serialize and deserialize these objects so that they can be stored in a database or file system.

The command interpreter will be used in all of the following projects, such as the HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, and front-end integration projects.

In other words, this is the foundation for building the AirBnB clone. It is the first step in learning the skills and concepts that will be needed to complete the project.
